# getcif

In recent years, the use of machine learning for predicting material properties and designing substances (known as materials informatics) has gained considerable attention.
The accuracy of machine learning depends heavily on the preparation of appropriate training data.
Therefore, the development of tools and environments for the rapid generation of training data is expected to contribute significantly to the advancement of research in materials informatics.

getcif is a tool to retrieve crystallographic information and other properties of materials from databases. The latest version of getcif provides access to Materials Project database. Users can search database and obtain information by specifying symmetry, composition, or physical properties of materials.

## Target database

Materials Project

## Requirement

Python3 with mp-api, pymatgen and other library packages

## Install

- From source

``` bash
python3 -m pip install DIRECTORY_OF_THE_REPOSITORY
```
